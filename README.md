# Share Riding Wallet

Project made as a combined wallet between me and my friends whom I share rides daily.
It's a mobile app written with Dart (Flutter Framework) and it has 2 sceens:
- Home Screen in which we can add and spend money to the wallet. We can also keep truck of who hasn't payed like others. And we can set the balance to the starting sum.
- History Screen in which we keep truck of all transactions. A delete button is also available to clear the history.

Data is stored locally on the phone, no internet of servers needed, in case of phone reboot, data is preserved of course !
